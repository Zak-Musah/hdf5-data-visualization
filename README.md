This HDF5 visualization project written with Flask web framework(Python) as backend and React (Javascript) as frontend is served in Docker containers. HDF5 format is a hierarchical data structure, consists mainly of the following components: attributes, groups and data sets. Attributes are used for storing meta-data. Groups and data sets could be considered as folders and files, respectively, in classical file system - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format.

Structure of IRUBIS HDF5 files Attributes:

- wavenumbers, array: Wx1, with W - number of data samples
  From here you can extract wavenumbers, which are commonly used as x-axis (horizontal) for plotting spectra.

Groups:

- internal
- external

The internal group has the following structure:

- glucose
- measurement
- time

time - integers, size Nx1, with N - number of data samples, consists of UNIX timestamps, at which a spectrum was measured.

measurement - floats, size NxW, with N - number of data samples, W - number of wavenumber, each row is a spectrum.

glucose - floats, size Nx1, with N - number of data samples, consists of glucose values that were calculated based on corresponding measurement spectra.

The goal of this task is to programmaticaly extract data from files and plot two graphs. One graph should contain glucose data points and the second, the corresponding spectrum.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with the following.

- Clone from Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zak-Musah/hdf5-data-visualization-react.git

cd hdf5-data-visualization-react

```

- Docker/Docker Compose should be installed before running the start command
- 3 docker containers were used - Backend (Python) , Frontend (Node) and Nginx

- To start both backend and frontend and run tests using local docker client, run the following from root of application:

```bash
sh ./start.sh
```

- In case the start.sh does not seem to be runnable, use

```bash
chmod 400 start.sh
```

- To run project without docker , follow these steps; Also change correct path of dataset folder in backend/api/**init**.py

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv env [Create a python environment]
source env/bin/activate
(env) pip install -r requirements.txt
(env) export FLASK_APP=api/__init__.py
(env) export REACT_APP_BACKEND_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5000
(env) python manage.py run [Navigate to http://localhost:5000/api/test for sanity check]


cd frontend
npm install
export REACT_APP_BACKEND_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5000
npm start [Automatically launches app in your default browser on http://localhost:3000]
```
